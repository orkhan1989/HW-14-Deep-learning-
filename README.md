Investors wants to guide their trading strategies from social media and news articles due to the volatility of cryptocurrency.
One indicator that can be used is Crypto Fear and Greed Index (FNG) which attempts to use different data sources to produce a daily FNG value for cryptocurrency. I will be using both FNG values and simple closing prices to build and evaluate deep learning models . and determine if the FNG indicator provides a better signal for cryptocurrencies than normal closing price data.
